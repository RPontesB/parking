Deployment with Spring Boot Jar Packaging

In this case we will be packaging the angular project as a jar. So no changes reqired in the client pom file.Also, we do not require to configure any maven plugin in the server pom file. Remove all the build configuration except spring-boot-maven-plugin. Don't forget to add client project jar dependency in the server pm file. So, now when we build our project the jar will be included in the META-INF/resources directory and Spring Boot is preconfigured to serve static content from this resources folder. One thing you require to change is in the build parameter of package.json.

"build": "ng build -prod â€“output-path META-INF/resources"

ng serve --open
